                            performed entirely through the mouth, avoiding external scars.

                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Unhealthy Diet: Regular consumption of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, sugary drinks, and processed snacks.

                        <h2>Treatment Procedure</h2>
                        <p>Treatment for obesity involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and, in some cases, surgical procedures. Lifestyle modifications include a balanced, calorie-controlled diet, regular physical activity, and behavioral therapy to address eating habits. Medications may be prescribed to reduce appetite or enhance weight loss. For severe cases, surgical options like gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or minimally invasive endoscopic procedures such as the Primary Obesity Surgery Endolumenal (POSE) may be recommended. These approaches aim to reduce stomach capacity and promote satiety. Success requires long-term adherence to healthy habits, regular follow-ups, and addressing underlying health conditions contributing to obesity.</p>

                        <p style={{marginTop:"-1rem"}}>How does POSE promote weight loss?</p>
                        <p style={{marginTop:"-1rem"}}>&#x2022; POSE reduces stomach volume by internal suturing, limiting food intake and promoting weight loss.</p>
                        <p style={{marginTop:"-1rem"}}>What is the recovery time after POSE?</p>
                        <p style={{marginTop:"-1rem"}}>&#x2022; Recovery is generally shorter compared to traditional surgical procedures. Most patients can resume normal activities within a few days.</p>
