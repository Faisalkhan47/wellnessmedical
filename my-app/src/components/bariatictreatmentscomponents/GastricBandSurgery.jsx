                    Gastric band surgery, also known as laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), is a type of bariatric (weight-loss) surgery. It involves placing a silicone band around the upper part of the stomach to create a small pouch that holds food. This limits the amount of food you can eat at one time, helping you feel full sooner and eat less overall.

                        <h2>Treatment Procedure</h2>
                        <p>The treatment procedure for gastric band surgery involves laparoscopic placement of an adjustable silicone band around the upper part of the stomach. This creates a small pouch that limits food intake, promoting satiety with smaller portions. The band is connected to a port under the skin, allowing adjustments by injecting or removing saline to control its tightness. Post-surgery, patients follow a liquid diet, gradually transitioning to soft and solid foods while adhering to portion control. Regular follow-ups are essential for band adjustments and monitoring. If complications like slippage, erosion, or infection occur, treatments may include band removal, repositioning, or addressing underlying issues.</p>

                        <h2>Choosing the Right Procedure for You</h2>
                        <p>Obesity level:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Weight loss surgery is generally recommended for people with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 40 or higher (severe obesity), or those with a BMI of 35 or higher with obesity-related health conditions (like diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnea).
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Existing health conditions:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Some surgeries may be better suited to individuals with specific health conditions. For instance, gastric bypass surgery may be a better option for people with type 2 diabetes.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Medical history:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Past surgeries, other chronic conditions, or potential complications may influence the choice. For example, if you have a history of gastrointestinal issues, certain procedures may be contraindicated.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Exercise:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Weight loss surgery is not a substitute for exercise. The success of the surgery depends on combining it with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Consider your willingness and ability to commit to an active lifestyle.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Psychological Support:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; It’s also important to evaluate your psychological readiness for weight loss surgery. Surgery alone is not a cure for obesity—it requires a commitment to long-term changes in behavior, diet, and lifestyle.
