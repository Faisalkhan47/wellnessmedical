                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>By reducing stomach size, gastric sleeve limits the amount of food that can be consumed. This leads to weight loss through portion control and changes in hormonal signals related to appetite.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
                        <p>Gastric sleeve surgery involves removing about 75-80% of the stomach, leaving a smaller, sleeve-shaped stomach. This reduces food intake and appetite by limiting capacity and lowering hunger hormones. The procedure is performed laparoscopically under general anesthesia, requiring small abdominal incisions. Patients typically stay in the hospital for 1-2 days. After surgery, a liquid diet is introduced, gradually progressing to soft and solid foods. Lifelong dietary changes, supplements, and regular follow-ups are necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Gastric sleeve surgery helps achieve significant weight loss and improve obesity-related health conditions but requires commitment to a healthy lifestyle for long-term success.</p>
