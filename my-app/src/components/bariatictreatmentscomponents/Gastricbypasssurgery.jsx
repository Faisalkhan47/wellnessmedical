                        <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
                        <p>The treatment procedure for gastric band surgery involves laparoscopic placement of an adjustable silicone band around the upper part of the stomach. This creates a small pouch that limits food intake, promoting satiety with smaller portions. The band is connected to a port under the skin, allowing adjustments by injecting or removing saline to control its tightness. Post-surgery, patients follow a liquid diet, gradually transitioning to soft and solid foods while adhering to portion control. Regular follow-ups are essential for band adjustments and monitoring. If complications like slippage, erosion, or infection occur, treatments may include band removal, repositioning, or addressing underlying issues.</p>

                        <h3>Choosing the Right Procedure for You</h3>
                        <p>Obesity-related Conditions:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Gastric bypass is particularly effective for people who have obesity-related health issues like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. The surgery can improve or even resolve many of these conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Weight Loss Goals:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Gastric bypass leads to substantial weight loss and is ideal for individuals who need to lose a significant amount of weight. If you're looking to lose a large percentage of your excess weight, gastric bypass might be the most effective surgical option.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Lifestyle Commitment:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Gastric bypass requires long-term dietary changes. After the procedure, you'll need to eat smaller portions and avoid high-calorie, sugary foods to avoid complications such as dumping syndrome (rapid gastric emptying that causes nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms).
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Gastric bypass:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; This surgery involves removing a large portion of the stomach, leaving a smaller, sleeve-shaped stomach. It's less invasive than gastric bypass and involves no rerouting of the intestines. However, it may result in less weight loss than gastric bypass.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Recovery and Long-Term Care:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Gastric bypass requires a more extended recovery time compared to some other weight loss surgeries, as it is a more complex procedure. You will need to follow a structured post-operative diet and attend follow-up appointments with your healthcare team to monitor your weight loss and nutritional intake.
