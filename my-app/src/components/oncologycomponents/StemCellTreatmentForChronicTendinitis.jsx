                    Injuries to the tendon can cause inflammation (tendonitis) and chronic pain, preventing movement and affecting your quality of life. Rotator cuff injury, Achilles tendon injury, and other forms of chronic tendonitis may respond well to stem cell treatment. Drs. Steven Struhl at Regenerative Orthopedics offers stem cell therapy for chronic pain tendonitis at our clinics in NYC and White Plains. Tendonitis can be caused by trauma or repeated use that damages the muscles. The result is inflammation that can cause pain and prevent movement. Rotator cuff shoulder cuffs are a common cause of chronic tendonitis pain. Knees, elbows, and other joints can also cause chronic tendonitis. Regenerative tendon healing helps reduce inflammation and pain, which can be achieved with stem cell therapy.

                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Gastric balloon placement is a weight-loss procedure that involves placing a saline-filled silicone balloon into the stomach. This help to loose weight by limiting the amount of food you can eat and making you feel fuller faster.</p>

                        <p>An intragastric balloon may be an option for you if:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; You're willing to commit to healthy lifestyle changes, get regular medical follow-up and participate in behavioral therapy</p>

                        <h2>Treatment Procedure</h2>
                        <p>During the gastric balloon procedure, a soft balloon (about the size of a grapefruit) is inserted into your stomach through your mouth, using an endoscope (a thin, flexible telescope). The balloon is then filled with saline to partially fill the stomach, allowing you to more easily control your portion sizes. You will be sedated during the procedure, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Most patients are able to go home the same day. At six months, the balloon is removed and your Virginia Mason support team will continue to guide you toward making healthy lifestyle choices in your nutrition and activity. The program they design for you will be essential to help you overcome the challenges of achieving your weight loss goals.</p>
