                    Cholangiocarcinoma is a cancer that forms in the slender tubes (bile ducts) that carry the digestive fluid bile. Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and to your small intestine. This condition, otherwise called bile duct cancer, is a remarkable type of cancer that happens for the most part in individuals more seasoned than age 50, however, it can happen at whatever stage in life. Specialists partition cholangiocarcinoma into various sorts dependent on where cancer growth happens in the bile pipes: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma happens in some parts of the bile conduits inside the liver and is now and again named a kind of liver cancer. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma happens in the bile ducts right outside of the liver. This sort is additionally called perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Distal cholangiocarcinoma happens in the segment of the bile duct closest to the small intestine.

                        <p>During the gastric balloon procedure, a soft balloon (about the size of a grapefruit) is inserted into your stomach through your mouth, using an endoscope (a thin, flexible telescope). The balloon is then filled with saline to partially fill the stomach, allowing you to more easily control your portion sizes. You will be sedated during the procedure, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Most patients are able to go home the same day. At six months, the balloon is removed and your Virginia Mason support team will continue to guide you toward making healthy lifestyle choices in your nutrition and activity. The program they design for you will be essential to help you overcome the challenges of achieving your weight loss goals.</p>
