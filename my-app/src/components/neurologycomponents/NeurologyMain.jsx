                    During your first appointment with a neurologist, theyâ€™ll likely perform a physical exam and a neurological exam. A neurological exam will test muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. Since different disorders can have similar symptoms, your neurologist may need more testing to make a diagnosis. Neurologists may recommend a variety of procedures to help diagnose or treat a condition.
