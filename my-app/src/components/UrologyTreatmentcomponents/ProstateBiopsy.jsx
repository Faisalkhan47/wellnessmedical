                    A prostate biopsy is a methodology to eliminate tests of dubious tissue from the prostate. The prostate is a little, walnut-shaped gland in males that produces liquid that sustains and transports sperm. During a prostate biopsy, a needle is utilized to gather various tissue tests from your prostate organ. The methodology is performed by a specialist in the urinary system and male sex organs. Your urologist might suggest a prostate biopsy if results from starting tests, like a prostate-explicit antigen (PSA) blood test or advanced rectal test, propose that you might have prostate cancer. Tissue tests from the prostate biopsy are inspected under a microscope lens for cell anomalies that are an indication of prostate disease. In case cancer is available, it is assessed to decide how rapidly it's probably going to advance and to decide your best treatment choices.

                        <p>Gastric balloon placement is a weight-loss procedure that involves placing a saline-filled silicone balloon into the stomach. This help to loose weight by limiting the amount of food you can eat and making you feel fuller faster.</p>

                        <h2>Treatment Procedure</h2>
                        <p>During the gastric balloon procedure, a soft balloon (about the size of a grapefruit) is inserted into your stomach through your mouth, using an endoscope (a thin, flexible telescope). The balloon is then filled with saline to partially fill the stomach, allowing you to more easily control your portion sizes. You will be sedated during the procedure, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Most patients are able to go home the same day. At six months, the balloon is removed and your Virginia Mason support team will continue to guide you toward making healthy lifestyle choices in your nutrition and activity. The program they design for you will be essential to help you overcome the challenges of achieving your weight loss goals.</p>
