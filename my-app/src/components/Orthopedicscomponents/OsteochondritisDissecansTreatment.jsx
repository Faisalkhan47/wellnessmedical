                    It affects joints, most often the knee, in children and teenagers. It can also affect different joints, such as elbows and ankles. This infirmity occurs when a part of the bone partly or fully severs from the end of the bone that forms a joint. This usually happens due to the lack of blood supply to the area. As the piece of the bone dissolves, the cartilage masking it cracks, and both may break loose. The area where the bone remnant breaks off is called a lesion. Although these lesions may occur in both of the paired joints, usually just one is affected.

                        <h2>Treatment Procedure</h2>
                        <p>During the gastric balloon procedure, a soft balloon (about the size of a grapefruit) is inserted into your stomach through your mouth, using an endoscope (a thin, flexible telescope). The balloon is then filled with saline to partially fill the stomach, allowing you to more easily control your portion sizes. You will be sedated during the procedure, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Most patients are able to go home the same day. At six months, the balloon is removed and your Virginia Mason support team will continue to guide you toward making healthy lifestyle choices in your nutrition and activity. The program they design for you will be essential to help you overcome the challenges of achieving your weight loss goals.</p>
