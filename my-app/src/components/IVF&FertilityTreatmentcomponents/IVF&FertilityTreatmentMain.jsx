                    IVF & Fertility Treatment is the process by which there is prevention of genetic problems and assistance with the conception of a child is possible. IVF is the most effective form of assisted reproductive technology. The procedure can be done using a couple's own eggs and sperm. IVF may involve eggs, sperm or embryos from a known or anonymous donor. In some cases, a gestational carrier, someone who has an embryo implanted in the uterus might be used.
