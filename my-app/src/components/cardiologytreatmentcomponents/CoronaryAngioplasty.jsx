                    Coronary angioplasty, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is a medical procedure used to treat blocked or narrowed coronary arteries, typically due to atherosclerosis. During the procedure, a catheter with a small balloon at its tip is inserted into the affected artery through a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. The balloon is inflated to widen the artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. In many cases, a stent (a small mesh tube) is placed to keep the artery open. Coronary angioplasty helps relieve chest pain (angina) and reduce the risk of heart attacks.</p>

                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; If lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, medication) and non-invasive treatments don’t relieve symptoms like chest pain, angioplasty may be necessary.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Health Conditions:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Suitable for patients with other health conditions (e.g., kidney disease, diabetes) where surgery may pose additional risks.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Recommended for patients with complex heart disease or diabetes, as it offers long-term benefits in such cases.</p>

                        <h3>Common Questions About Coronary Angioplasty</h3>
                        <p>What is coronary angioplasty?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Coronary angioplasty is a procedure used to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries to restore blood flow to the heart. It involves inserting a catheter with a balloon into the artery, which is inflated to widen the passage. A stent is often placed to keep the artery open.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>How long does the procedure take?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; The procedure typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the complexity and number of blockages being treated.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Is coronary angioplasty painful?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Most patients experience minimal discomfort during the procedure, as it is done under local anesthesia. Mild pain or soreness may occur afterward at the catheter insertion site.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>What is the recovery time?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Recovery is usually quick. Most people can resume normal activities within a few days to a week. Full recovery may take a few weeks.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Are there risks associated with angioplasty?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; While angioplasty is generally safe, risks include bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke, or damage to the blood vessels. However, these complications are rare.</p>

                        <h3>Myths and Facts About Coronary Angioplasty</h3>
                        <p>Myth: Angioplasty is a cure for heart disease.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: Angioplasty treats the symptoms of blocked arteries by improving blood flow, but it doesn't cure heart disease. Lifestyle changes and medication are essential to managing the condition long-term.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: Angioplasty is a very risky procedure.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: Coronary angioplasty is generally safe with a high success rate. Serious complications are rare, and the procedure is minimally invasive compared to open-heart surgery.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: You can resume normal activities immediately after angioplasty.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: After angioplasty, you’ll need to rest and gradually return to normal activities. Full recovery may take a few weeks, depending on the individual's condition and the complexity of the procedure.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: If you have a stent, you don’t need to worry about your heart health.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: While stents help keep arteries open, it's important to continue heart-healthy habits such as eating well, exercising, and managing stress to prevent further blockages or complications.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: Only older people need coronary angioplasty.
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: Coronary artery disease can affect people of any age, especially those with risk factors like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, or diabetes. Angioplasty may be needed at any stage of life if significant blockages are present.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: Angioplasty will prevent heart attacks permanently.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: Angioplasty reduces the risk of heart attack by improving blood flow, but it doesn’t prevent future heart attacks. Ongoing medical management, including lifestyle changes and medication, is crucial for long-term heart health.
