                    Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove plaque buildup from the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. This procedure reduces the risk of stroke by improving blood flow. It is typically performed in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis or narrowing, often due to atherosclerosis.

                        <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
                        <p>The treatment for carotid artery disease aims to reduce stroke risk by improving blood flow. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and managing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol are essential. Medications may include antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin) and statins to lower cholesterol. Surgical options include carotid endarterectomy, where the plaque is removed to clear the artery, or carotid artery stenting, which involves placing a stent to keep the artery open. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of stenosis and the patient's overall health.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Choosing the Right Procedure for You</h3>
                        <p>Severity of Carotid Artery Narrowing:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Mild to Moderate Stenosis (Less than 70% narrowing)</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA):</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Best for: Patients with severe stenosis (greater than 70%) or symptomatic carotid artery disease. </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; This is a more invasive procedure, often preferred for patients with good overall health and those who can tolerate surgery.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS):</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Best for: Patients who are at higher surgical risk due to age, frailty, or other medical conditions.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Less invasive than surgery, but may not be suitable for all patients, particularly those with certain artery conditions or complex blockages.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Other Considerations:</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Anatomy of the Carotid Arteries: Certain anatomical conditions (e.g., tortuous or heavily calcified arteries) may make surgery more difficult, in which case stenting may be a better option.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Patient Preference: After discussing the risks and benefits of each procedure with the doctor, patient preference regarding the invasiveness and recovery time of each option is an important factor.</p>

                        <p>What is a carotid endarterectomy?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; A surgical procedure to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries to restore normal blood flow and reduce the risk of stroke.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Who needs a carotid endarterectomy?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Patients with significant carotid artery narrowing (usually ≥50-70%) and symptoms like transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke, or asymptomatic patients with ≥70% narrowing and high stroke risk.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>How is the surgery performed?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; A surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens the carotid artery, removes the plaque, and repairs the artery using sutures or a patch.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Is the procedure safe?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; While generally safe, there are risks, including stroke, heart attack, nerve injury, or infection.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>What are the alternatives to surgery?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Alternatives include carotid artery stenting (CAS) or medical management with medications and lifestyle changes.</p>
