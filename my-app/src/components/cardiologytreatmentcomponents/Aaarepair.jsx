                            Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) repair involves surgically treating a bulging or weakened section of the abdominal aorta to prevent rupture. It can be done through open surgery, replacing the damaged area with a synthetic graft, or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), where a stent graft is inserted through blood vessels. Timely intervention reduces life-threatening risks like rupture and internal bleeding.

                        <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
                        <p>Treatment for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) depends on its size, growth rate, and symptoms. Small, asymptomatic aneurysms are typically managed with regular imaging to monitor growth and lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure. For larger or symptomatic aneurysms, intervention is required to prevent rupture. Open surgical repair involves replacing the weakened section of the aorta with a synthetic graft through a large abdominal incision. Alternatively, Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive option where a stent graft is inserted via a catheter through the groin and positioned inside the aneurysm. Treatment choice varies by patient.</p>

                        <p>What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; An AAA is a bulging or weakening of the aorta, the main blood vessel in the abdomen. It can lead to rupture if untreated.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>How do I know if I have an AAA?
                        </p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Many AAAs are asymptomatic, but some may cause pain or a pulsating sensation in the abdomen. Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>What causes an AAA?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Common causes include atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, smoking, and family history. Age also plays a significant role.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>How is an AAA diagnosed?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; AAAs are typically diagnosed through imaging tests like ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>What is the treatment for an AAA?</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Treatment depends on the size and risk of rupture. Small aneurysms may be monitored, while larger or symptomatic ones require surgical repair—either open surgery or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).</p>

                        <p>Myth: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) are always painful.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: Most AAAs are asymptomatic and may not cause pain until they grow large or rupture.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>Myth: AAA only affects older adults.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginTop: "-1rem" }}>&#x2022; Fact: While more common in people over 65, AAAs can affect younger individuals, especially those with risk factors like smoking or family history.</p>
