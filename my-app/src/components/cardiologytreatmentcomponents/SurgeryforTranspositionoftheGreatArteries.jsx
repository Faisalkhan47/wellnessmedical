                    Surgery for Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) involves correcting the congenital heart defect where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched. The arterial switch operation (ASO) is the most common procedure, restoring normal blood flow by repositioning arteries. It’s usually performed in infancy to ensure proper oxygenation and heart function.

                        <h3>Treatment Procedure</h3>
                        <p>The primary treatment for Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) is surgery, typically performed within the first few days of life. The most common procedure is the Arterial Switch Operation (ASO), where the aorta and pulmonary artery are repositioned to their correct locations. This restores normal blood flow and oxygenation. In some cases, a balloon atrial septostomy may be performed temporarily to improve oxygen levels by creating a hole in the atrial septum. After surgery, ongoing follow-up care is necessary to monitor heart function, as children may require additional procedures or medications as they grow. Early intervention improves long-term outcomes.</p>
